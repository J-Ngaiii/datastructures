def remove(arr, x) -> Tuple[List, int]:
    """
    Returns the original array but with all occurences of x removed and the size of the updated array.

    Core pieces of logic are: 
    - The boundary pointer designates the boundary (next open slot) of the processed array and updates in sync with the forloop
        - The boundary pointer becomes detached only if it encounters an instance of the x elem to be removed
        - In which case it lets the forloop pointer move forward and stays on the index where arr[index] == x
        - Such that the next time the forloop pointer hits an elem that isn't an instance of x it overwrites the element to be removed
    - Then we can also return the boundary itself as a count of the number of valid numbers in the final array

    Returns the length of the longest substring of unique characters within the inputted string.

    
    Core Logic
    - If the right pointer character is NOT in the existing set --> add to the set, check the size and push the right pointer forward
    - If the right pointer character IS in the existing set --> we keep moving the left pointer until we the right pointer character is no longer in the set 
        - Why incorporate the new character the right pointer is on? We have to be able to keep moving forward

    Lesson
    - Whenever you have to maintain a sequence/window of unique elements/know what each elem is => generally need a set
    - If you just need a sequence/window that satisfies some quality (eg. sums to some amount)/don't care about what elems are in the window, just the condition => generally can get away with just pointers
